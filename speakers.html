                      <i>“Today education systems need to be reimagined and reinvented to respond to the multiple ethical challenges of societies, but also to the globalized nature of our daily interactions and lives. Education systems need to retrieve the very essence of the meaning of education, that aims to lead out, to help children to develop to their full potential, not just intellectually, but also emotionally, relationally and spiritually.”</i>
